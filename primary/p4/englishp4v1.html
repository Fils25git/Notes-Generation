        <p>People in traditional communities lived simple lives. Most of them were farmers. They kept animals like cattle and goats. They also grew food crops. There are differences between traditional and modern farming . People grew less crops . These included sorghum, millet, sweet potatoes and cassava. The crops were mainly eaten by those who grew them . Few people sold what they grew. The people also used fewer tools like hoes, machetes and exes . Not much meat was eaten either.</p>
        
        <p>In modern farming, we use more machines. We grow more crops including tea and coffee . A lot of crops are grown for export. The farmers are able to cultivate bigger pieces of land . They keep cows like Friesian and Jersey. These cows give more milk than traditional cattle .</p>

    <h2>10.1. Describing the Climate Change</h2>
    
    <p>There is something happening in our world, changes are taking place every day . We do not change at once .</p>
    
    <p><strong>Climate</strong> is total weather conditions of a place. weather conditions are measured over a long period . That is what tells us the climate of a place.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Temperature</strong> is the hotness or coldness of a place. It has been observed that our world temperature is rising .</p>

<div class="content-section">
    <h2>10.2. Describing the causes of Climate Change</h2>
    
    <p>What are the causes of climate change? People are the causes of climate change . We are destroying the environment every day . The environment is what surrounding us . This includes plants, rivers, the air and so on. We are cutting down too many trees</p>
    
    <p>We burn wood to make fire and charcoal. We also use the wood to build houses and make furniture . Trees reduce the harmful gases in the atmosphere. The gases come from the vehicles and factories . Without trees , the gases will make world temperature rise .</p>

    <h2>10.3. Describing our Responsibilities</h2>
    
    <p>It is clear that climate change has negative effects. It is making life harder for us. Is there anything we can do about it? Yes, there is the fight against climate change.</p>
    
    <p>Since the rainfall has reduced, we must not waste water. We must use less water. We must save the little we have . This way we can use it for much longer.</p>
    
    <p>We must not burn so much wood. We must avoid relying on firewood and charcoal for cooking . We must look for other sources of fuel. If we cut down trees , we must replace them . we must learn to plant more trees than we cut down.</p>
