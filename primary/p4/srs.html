<h1>UNIT 1: SOCIAL-ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN OUR DISTRICT</h1>

<h2>1.1 Identify my district</h2>
<p>A district is an area in which people live.</p>
<p>A neighborhood is the area close to you.</p>
<p>Neighbors are the people who live next to you.</p>
<p>Neighboring districts are next to the district in which you live.</p>
<p>A province is a region that is bigger than a district. Each district is a part of a province.</p>
<p>In Rwanda we have five provinces and 30 districts.</p>
<p>These are our five provinces:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Eastern Province</li>
    <li>Kigali City</li>
    <li>Northern Province</li>
    <li>Southern Province</li>
    <li>Western Province</li>
</ul>

<p>Each province is divided into districts as follows:</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Province</th>
            <th>Districts</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Kigali City</td>
            <td>Gasabo, Kicukiro, Nyarugenge</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Eastern Province</td>
            <td>Bugesera, Gatsibo, Kayonza, Kirehe, Ngoma, Nyagatare, Rwamagana</td>
        </tr>

            <td>Burera, Gicumbi, Gakenke, Musanze, Rulindo</td>
        </tr>

            <td>Karongi, Ngororero, Nyabihu, Nyamasheke, Rubavu, Rutsiro, Rusizi</td>

<h2>1.2 District map</h2>
<img src="https://www.worldatlas.com/upload/8a/e6/55/provinces-of-rwanda-map.png" alt="Map of Rwanda showing provinces and districts colored by province">

<p>Our school is located in Eastern Province and Nyagatare District.</p>
<p>Our district is bordered by Gicumbi District and Gatsibo District. Our district is made up of 18 sectors.</p>

<h2>1.3 Social-economic activities in our district</h2>
<p>A social activity is where we contact or meet people.</p>
<p>An economic activity is when we make, buy and sell goods.</p>
<p>A social-economic activity is a mix of social and economic activities. The two activities go together.</p>
<p><strong>E.g.:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>When we buy or sell goods, we talk to people.</li>
    <li>We meet and spend time with them.</li>
    <li>When we work to earn money, we work with people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Social-economic activities are things that people do to earn money.</p>

<h2>1.4 Examples of socio-economic activities</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Agriculture and farming</li>
    <li>Fishing</li>
    <li>Trade</li>
    <li>Crafts</li>
    <li>Pottery</li>
    <li>Tourism</li>
    <li>Employment</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.5 Social activities</h2>

    <li>People play sports together</li>
    <li>People go to church</li>
    <li>People get married and start families</li>
    <li>Children visit their parents and grandparents</li>
    <li>People visit their neighbors</li>
    <li>Many people like to share food with each other</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.6 Social-economic activities in neighboring districts</h2>
<p>There are social-economic activities in your district and in all the other districts. Some are the same and others are different.</p>
<p>The existence of social-economic activities depends on the following things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How many people live in the district?</li>
    <li>What the natural resources are</li>
    <li>Which products grow well in the area</li>
    <li>What people need and want</li>
    <li>How easy or difficult it is for people to meet</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of socio-economic activities in neighboring districts:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>In districts where there are national parks, there are activities dealing with tourism</li>
    <li>In areas where there is water, there are fishing activities e.g., areas around lakes</li>
    <li>In Kigali City, there are more shops and businesses than in rural areas</li>
    <li>There is more farming in some areas than others</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.7 The importance of social-economic activities</h2>

<p><strong>Importance of each social-economic activity:</strong></p>

    <h1>UNIT 2: PEACE EDUCATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS</h1>

<h2>2.1 Human rights</h2>
<p>Human rights are things that every person should enjoy because they are human beings.</p>
<p>Human rights give you power to live well. This is because:</p>

    <li>They are the same for all people</li>
    <li>It allows you to be happy</li>
    <li>You can become the person you want to be</li>
